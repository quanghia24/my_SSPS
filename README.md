## Overview
HCMUT_SSPS is a smart printing service for HCMUT students to use the printing facilities in HCMUT more efficiently. The students can use this system to pre-order their printing needs without having to wait in a line in traditional method. The system also provides a feature of storing your printing information, such as the metadata of the document, amount, date, time, location... of each of your order. Students can then view all the details of their system usage in the history.

The system is managed by the Student Printing Service Officer (SPSO). They are responsible for configuring the system, managing the printers and viewing the statistics and performance of the HCMUT_SSPS. SPSO can also view users' printing history.

The service is now online and you can have a try on it.
